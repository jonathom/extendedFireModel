# Extended Fire Model

* fire_neighbourhoods.py contains the basic fire model architecture, extended only by the use of larger neighbourhoods
* fire_ext.py contains a rewritten fire model with no continuous burning and the introduction of neighbourhoods and tree species
* the .map data is originated here: http://karssenberg.geo.uu.nl/labs/index.html
